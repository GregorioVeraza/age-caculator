## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned mainly:
- how to handle **HTML forms entries** with JavaScript 
- how to handle **CSS styles** with JavaScript
- modify DOM elements, for instance to change texts

I am proud of how I modularized the code with functions and I tried to avoid duplicate code.

### Continued development
I think that there are some things which I can improve such as how I handle errors with strings instead of using error objects.
